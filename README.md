### Hello! 👋
I am student in systems analysis and development at <a href="https://www.ifsp.edu.br/">IFSP</a>, generalist by nature but trying to get deeper into data engineering.
- 🔭 I'm currently working on named entities recognition. Also, I'm improving my data structures and algorithms skills regularly.
- 🌱 I'm improving knowledge of machine learning and deep learning.
- 🤝 I'm looking to collaborate on data science projects and web systems development.

This is my portfolio and thanks for visiting, see ya!
